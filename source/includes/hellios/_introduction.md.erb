# Introduction: Hellios API
Welcome to the Hellios API documentation.

The Hellios API has been built to allow Hellios' customers to access their supplier questionnaire information programmatically without needing to sign into the Hellios portal. 

The API adheres to the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>. <span style="background-color:#39FF14">It uses resource-oriented URLs, accepts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms" target="blank">form-encoded</a> request bodies and returns <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">JSON</a>-encoded responses. It uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.</span>

The Hellios API is READ-ONLY. Data can only be consumed, no changes or updates can be made via the API.
