```csharp

```

To access an individual supplier's status information, use the <code>GetSupplierInformation</code> method, passing in the unique 'SupplierId' parameter. However, you may need to use the <code>GetSuppliers</code> method first in order to find the unique 'SupplierId' value.

If you already know the 'SupplierId' value, please skip straight to <a href="#uc5-getsupplierinformation">Get individual supplier information</a> below.

If you need to find the 'SupplierId' value, first use the <code>GetSuppliers</code> method to retrieve a list of all suppliers. In this example we want to retrieve a list of all suppliers, including 'Expired' suppliers so will set the parameters as follows.

<code>type: All</code><br/>
<code>tag: *NULL*</code><br/>
<code>includeExpired: True</code>

The code examples opposite show how to post to the Hellios API using <code>GetSuppliers</code>.

<code>GetSuppliers</code> will return a list of suppliers in JSON format. Each supplier listed will include two  atrributes important to this use case:

- a unique Hellios supplier identifier, 'SupplierId'
- the name of the supplier, 'Supplier Name'

By parsing the JSON returned from <code>GetSuppliers</code> you should be able to locate the supplier you're interested by matching on their name (the 'Supplier Name' attribute.) Once you have located the supplier, extract their 'SupplierId', to use with the <code>GetSupplierInformation</code> method.

<a name="uc5-getsupplierinformation"></a>

**Get individual supplier information**

The 'SupplierId' value allows you to retrieve data for any given supplier by using the <code>GetSupplierInformation</code> method. When posting to the <code>GetSupplierInformation</code> method, include the 'SupplierId' parameter.

To access just the status information for this particular supplier, extract the following attributes from the JSON.
